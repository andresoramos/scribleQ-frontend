hello andres of 2021!

Your friends here in 2020 need you to pick up where we left off.  Firstly, in purchased quizzes, you need to see if you can make it 
so that when you go to check the analytics of a free downloaded quiz, you end up updating the state in app to pass down a "paid"
prop to analytics.  Also, you need to make sure that once it does that properly, that the 'hidden' object affixed to your quiz
doesn't end up causing parts of it to get trimmed unnecessarily.
